# 🤖 CIFAR-10 Image Classifier

This project demonstrates my skills in **deep learning** and **computer vision**.  
It uses a pre-trained **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) — a standard benchmark for image recognition.

## 🎯 Project Goal

To build and test an image classification model capable of recognizing objects such as:
🚗 Car, ✈️ Airplane, 🐱 Cat, 🐶 Dog, 🛳️ Ship, 🐸 Frog, etc.

## 🧠 What the Program Does

1. Loads the **CIFAR-10 dataset** and visualizes sample images.  
2. Preprocesses the data by scaling pixel values (normalization).  
3. Loads a pre-trained CNN model from `image_classifier.keras`.  
4. Classifies a new input image (e.g. `car.jpg`).  
5. Displays the prediction result and the confidence score.
